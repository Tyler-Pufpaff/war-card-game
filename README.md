# My Awesome Project
Classic War card game built using a 52 deck API

<!-- **Link to project:**  -->

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

The API objects were exhaustive in properties and I did not initally prepare to account for the various Type errors. I ended up creating some JS functionality such that I would convert vlaues to the Types I needed to produce the correct gameplay functionality.
